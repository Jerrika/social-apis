## The Challenge:

The challenge was to build a RESTful API that allows a social media startup to perform CRUD operations on users, thoughts, and reactions data models using a NoSQL database. The API must be built using Node.js and Mongoose and must provide endpoints that can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

API must allow users to:

- Create and delete user accounts.
- Create, read, update, and delete thoughts.
- Add and remove reactions to thoughts.
- Add and remove friends to a user's friend list.

Test API: use Insomnia or a similar tool to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints and verify that the responses are correct.

## Assigned User Story:
```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria:
```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```

## Usage Instructions:

1. Repository: Open documentation run 'npm i' and update '.env'.
2. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
3. Once the server is running, use a tool like Insomnia to test the API endpoints. 
4. Use Insomnia to test http://localhost:3001 with the following route end points API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags, ensuring successful creation, updating, and deletion of data in the database.

#### Available Endpoints:

Each endpoint must include the necessary data in the request body or URL parameters as specified in the acceptance criteria.

1. GET /api/users - get all users
2. GET /api/users/:userId - get a single user by ID
3. POST /api/users - create a new user
4. PUT /api/users/:userId - update a user by ID
5. DELETE /api/users/:userId - delete a user by ID
6. GET /api/thought - get all thought
7. GET /api/thought/:thoughtId - get a single thought by ID
8. POST /api/thought - create a new thought
9. PUT /api/thought/:thoughtId - update a thought by ID
10. DELETE /api/thought/:thoughtId - delete a thought by ID
11. POST /api/thought/:thoughtId/reactions - add a reaction to a thought
12. DELETE /api/thought/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId - remove a reaction from a thought
13. POST /api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId - add a friend to a user's friend list
14. DELETE /api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId - remove a friend from a user's friend list
